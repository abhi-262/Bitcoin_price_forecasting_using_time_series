# Bitcoin_price_forecasting_using_time_series
In summary, this project focused on forecasting Bitcoin price movements using ARIMA and SARIMA models. The dataset spanning from 2014 to 2023 was preprocessed, and stationarity was achieved through differencing. Both models were built and tested, leading to future price predictions. However, aligning the forecasted line seamlessly with the historical data in the visual representation proved to be a challenge. Additionally, the project explored trading volume patterns and analyzed price returns at various intervals. Overall, this project highlighted the significance of time series analysis for understanding and predicting cryptocurrency prices, offering insights valuable to traders, investors, and researchers in the ever-changing crypto landscape.
